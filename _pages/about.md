Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Jackson School of Global Affairs](https://jackson.yale.edu) and Department of Political Science at Yale University. I completed my PhD at Cornell University. My research focuses on topics in international political economy, law and organization. In my current research, I study how the growth of international commercial arbitration has influenced domestic legal development and the power of countries to regulate foreign commerce. I also have ongoing research projects in related areas including the evolution of the international arbitration profession, anti-bribery law, and global competition law.

Please feel free to get in touch with me [here.](mailto:michael.allen@yale.edu)
