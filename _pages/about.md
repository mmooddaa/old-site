Welcome!

Beginning Fall 2023 I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and Department of Government at [Harvard University](https://www.gov.harvard.edu/). Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Yale University. I completed my PhD at Cornell University. My research focuses on topics in international political economy, law and organization. In my current research, I study how the growth of international commercial arbitration has influenced domestic legal development and the power of countries to regulate foreign commerce. I also have ongoing research projects in related areas including the evolution of the international arbitration profession, anti-bribery law, and global competition law.
