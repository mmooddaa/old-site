Welcome!

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and Department of Government at [Harvard University](https://www.gov.harvard.edu/). My research interests span international political economy, international institutions, and law, with a focus on the politics of global capitalism and democracy. In my current research, I study how the growth of private authority influences domestic legal development and the power of countries to regulate foreign commerce. I also have ongoing research projects in related areas including transnational anti-corruption efforts and global competition law. I was previously a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University and I hold a PhD in Government from Cornell University.
